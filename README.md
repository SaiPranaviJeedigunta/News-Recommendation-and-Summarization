# News Article Recommendation System with Summarization

This project implements a recommendation system for news articles based on textual summaries and similarity scores.

## Introduction

The News Article Recommendation System recommends similar news articles based on textual summaries and utilizes natural language processing techniques for summarization and similarity scoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Library for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and summarization.

## Summarization Process

The system uses NLTK for text summarization, condensing each article into a concise summary. The summaries are then combined with other metadata (such as publication date and category) to calculate similarity scores between articles.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing raw text data.
2. **Summarization**: Applying NLTK-based summarization techniques (e.g., extractive summarization) to generate brief summaries.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing both textual summaries and metadata for similarity scoring.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Generating recommendations based on similarity scores.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Summarization Techniques**: Implement more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., using Transformer-based models) to enhance the quality and conciseness of article summaries.
  
- **Enhanced Recommendation Algorithms**: Incorporate additional factors such as article popularity, user preferences, or real-time trends to improve recommendation accuracy.

- **Scalability**: Optimize the system to handle larger datasets efficiently and support real-time recommendation scenarios.
